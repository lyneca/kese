Gambling functions as per the [Gambling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#Gambling) downtime activity from XGtE, with the following modifications:

- You can invest a maximum of 500 gp.
- The DC for each of the checks is 9 + 2d10.
    - *This is an increase of 2 over the base amount of 5 + 2d10.*
- Once you have had six total successes in a town or city within a two-month period, your notoriety as a gambling expert will have spread to the point where nobody wants to play you anymore. You cannot perform this downtime activity in this location until at least a month has passed since your last gambling session.
    - *As you need 3 successes to double your money, this means that you hit the cap after doubling your money twice.*

- The year is 2550 ADK (4550 JT)
- The Lands of [[Kese]] are in a time of relative, fragile peace.
- The allied reptilian inhabitants of [[North Tellina]] and [[South Tellina]] are at a standoff with the [[Empire of Liverna]]. They’d both really like to kill each other, but they’re blocked by [[Moradin’s Teeth]].
- [[Kel]] is also waging guerilla warfare against [[Liverna]].
- The arch-lich [[Dyrn]] is clearly amassing an undead army in [[Karys]], which is probably not good.
- The high elves of the [[Queendom of Andyn]] are as snooty as usual.

- The year is 2550 ADK (4550 JT)
- The Lands of [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Places/Kese]] are in a time of relative, fragile peace.
- The allied reptilian inhabitants of [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Places/Regions/North Tellina/North Tellina]] and [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Places/Regions/South Tellina/South Tellina]] are at a standoff with the [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Groups/Empire of Liverna]]. They’d both really like to kill each other, but they’re blocked by [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Places/Regions/Moradin's Teeth/Moradin’s Teeth]].
- [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Places/Regions/Kel/Kel]] is also waging guerilla warfare against [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Places/Regions/Liverna/Liverna]].
- The arch-lich [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Creatures/Enemies/Dyrn]] is clearly amassing an undead army in [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Places/Regions/Karys/Karys]], which is probably not good.
- The high elves of the [[Drunken Donuts/Universe/Groups/Queendom of Andyn]] are as snooty as usual.

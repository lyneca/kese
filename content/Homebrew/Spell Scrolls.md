Rules-as-written, you cannot cast a spell unless it is on your spell list. This defeats a lot of very fun reasons for why you should use scrolls at all, so that rule is removed with the following replacement:

If the spell is of a level you can cast and is on your Spell List, you may cast it without a check using the relevant Spellcasting Ability as if you were casting one of your own spells.

If the spell is on your Spell List, but is of a higher level than you can cast, you can make a check to cast the spell. The DC is 10 + the spell's level, and you roll with your Spellcasting Ability and Proficiency Bonus. The DC for Cantrips is 10.

If the spell is not on your Spell List, you can make an _Intelligence (Arcana)_ check with a DC of 10 + the spell's level to try to cast the scroll. The DC for Cantrips is 10.

Regardless of the outcome, the scroll then disintegrates.

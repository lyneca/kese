There are two types of Inspiration you can receive as a player: Session Inspiration, and Heroic Inspiration. Both function identically, and you can have at max one of each type at any one time.

> [!info] Session Inspiration
> You gain Session Inspiration at the start of each real-life session. It is wasted if not used by the end of that session.

> [!info] Heroic Inspiration
> Heroic Inspiration is gained rules-as-written, by any features that grant it normally, or as a reward for performing particularly heroic or notable individual feats.

You can use Inspiration after you roll any dice. If the dice is a D20 Test, you may choose to use Inspiration after you know whether you passed, if applicable. If you rolled with Advantage, you may also roll your Inspiration roll with Advantage.

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least **24** hours—available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. **You may only perform a Long Rest in a safe location, such as a tavern, bastion, or your ship.**
